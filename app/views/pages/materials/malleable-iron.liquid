  main/content: We work with the best malleable iron foundries in the world.  Malleable
    iron is used wherever fully functional and machinable thin-walled sections are
    required.  Applications also include larger products of older design.<br><br>Whether
    domestic supply or imports - our partners assure fast delivery of certified product.  Our
    spectrum ranges from industrial to military application - ferritic or pearlitic
    malleable iron.<br><br>For high volume applications of parts weighing less than
    2 pounds, we work with VS, the finest green sand foundry in the world that is
    able to produce cast threads (ACME and NPT as seen herr) and fully weldable alloys.<br><br>For
    lower volumes and larger parts, we source domestically or in some cases in LCC.
