    work with the best malleable iron foundries in the world. Malleable iron is used
    wherever fully functional and machinable thin-walled sections are required. Applications
    also include larger products of older design.<br></div><br>Whether domestic supply
    or imports - our partners assure fast delivery of certified product. Our spectrum
    ranges from industrial to military application - ferritic or pearlitic malleable
    iron.<br><br>For high volume applications of parts weighing less than 2 pounds,
    we work with VS, the finest green sand foundry in the world that is able to produce
    cast threads (ACME and NPT as seen herr) and fully weldable alloys.<br><br>For
    lower volumes and larger parts, we source domestically or in some cases in LCC.
