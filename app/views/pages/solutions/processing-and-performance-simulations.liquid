    to provide design and development support, which includes complete simulation
    services.<br><br>Our engineers are experienced casting designers and can, upon
    request, provide manufacturing drawings.<br><br>Finally, we can simulate the physical
    performance of the castings, allowing redesigns and improvements prior to building
    tooling, which tends to be far more costly and time consuming.<br><br>Provide
    us with samples, drawings or digital files - and we can help you design a sound
    casting and engineered component.<br></p>"
