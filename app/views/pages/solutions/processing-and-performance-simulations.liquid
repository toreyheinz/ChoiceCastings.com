    to provide design and development source, which includes complete simulation services.<br><br>Our
    engineers are experienced in casting design and will provide 3D images (seen on
    right in center) and can, upon request, provide manufacturing drawings, depicted
    in the center drawing.<br><br>Finally, we can simulate the physical performance
    of the castings, allowing redesigns and improvements without the need for new
    or modified tooling, which tends to be far more costly and time consuming.<br><br>Provide
    us with samples, drawings or digital files - and we can help you design a sound
    casting and engineered component.<br></p>"
